  Book That help :
  
 Book read a vast number of books available on this subject. I have come to find that while there are a lot of good books out there that actually help you gain useful information, there are even more books that are just pure play marketing material shoved down the throats of the ignorant reader.

Below are my recommendations of books, categorized based on different aspects of the business that you may be interested in understanding.

Basics: For the layman who is new to this field and wants a headstart.
1) Inside the Black Box by Rishi Narang - Great book for a headstart on all the different aspects of quant trading. Very general information, but broadly brushes through every aspect of the business.
2) Quantitative Trading by Ernie Chan - Perfect book to get started on all the basic concepts with details on backtesting and some simple strategies to get started on with.

Programming: Depends, which platform you want to use. There are tons of books and online tutorials available on each programming language. I'd recommend the following on Python and Java.
1) Learning Python by Mark Lutz - Covers basics of python. Good to get you started.
2) Head First Java by Kathy Sierra - Great book on JAVA, right from basics to advanced.

Market Microstructure: Before you learn anything about algo strategies, it is most important to understand how trading works and how the different stakeholders interact with each other to create a market.
Trading and Exchanges by Larry Harris - Covers market microstructure in grave depth. A must read before diving into strategies to get a good understanding of the markets.

Strategies: Good books on strategies of varied nature (Momentum, Trend Following, Pairs Trading, Greeks etc). I have also categorized these books based on the kind of strategies that the books focus on.
1) Algorithmic Trading by Ernie Chan - A more advanced book by Ernie, with a number of interesting strategies to try out and backtest. Lot of good theory explaining the basic concepts behind the existence of different types of market behaivour and how to capture them.
2) Mechanical Trading Systems by Richard Weissman - Great book for strategies. Covers a plethora of momentum and mean reversion strategies on multiple time frames, along with backtested results.
3) Following The Trend by Andreas Clenow - I consider this book, one of the best reads on the topic of Trend Following, a very popular trading strategy.
4) Pairs Trading by Ganapathy Vidyamurthy - Very good book on a popular trading strategy known as Pairs Trading.
5) How to Make Money in Stocks by William O Neil - An excellent read on a very interesting fundamentals based quant model, called CANSLIM.

Options Strategies: I cover options strategies under a different topic, considering that they are much more complex as compared to equities/futures.
1) Options Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg - One of the best books on options for a begginer, working your way up from the basics all the way upto greeks and volatility trading.
2) The Bible of Options Strategies by Guy Cohen - Good book to get upto speed on all the different options setups and their specific greeks.
3) Volatility Trading by Euan Sinclair - Very advanced and in depth book on the concept of Volatility Trading. I believe it to be the best on this subject.

Risk Management: The most imporatant aspect of quant trading which is often overlooked.
Position Sizing by Van Tharp - A gem of a book that explains the idea of risk management and money management using different techniques.

My advice to a budding algo trader would be to research thoroughly before going live with a strategy. Consider yourself a risk manager rather than a money manager. Managing risk comes first, then come returns.
